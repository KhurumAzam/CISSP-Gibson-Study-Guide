Controlling Access to Assets (Page 639-640)
  •	Tangible: assets refer to things you can touch, such as physical equipment.
  •	Intangible: assets refer to information and data, such as intellectual property
  •	Assets within an Organization
    o Information – An organization’s information includes all its data.
    o Logical access controls attempt to prevent unauthorized access to the information.
    o	Systems - An organization’s systems include any IT systems that provide one or more services
    o	Devices - Devices refer to any computing system, including routers, switches, servers, desktop computers, portable laptop computers, tablets, smartphones, and external devices such as printers
    o	Facilities - An organization’s facilities include any physical location that it owns or rents.
    o	Applications - Applications frequently provide access to an organization’s data.

Controlling Physical and Logical Access (Page 640)
  •	Physical Security Controls protect Systems, Devices, and Facilities by controlling access and controlling the environment.
  •	Logical Access Controls are the technical controls used to protect access to Information, systems, devices, and applications. They include authentication, authorization, and permissions. 

The CIA Triad and Access Controls (Page 640-641)
  •	There are three categories of IT Loss: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA).
   o	Confidentiality: Access Controls help ensure that only authorized subjects can access objects.
      	When unauthorized entities can access systems or data, it results in a loss of confidentiality.
   o	Integrity: Ensures that data or system configurations are not modified without authorizations, or if unauthorized changes occur, security controls detect the changes.
   o	Availability: Authorized requests for objects must be granted to subjects within a reasonable amount of time. If systems are not operational or the data is not accessible, it results in a loss of availability. 

Managing Identification and Authentication (Page 641-642)
  •	Identification: The process of a subject claiming, or professing, and identity. The subject providing an identity will start the authentication, authorization, and accountability processes. This can be typing a username, smartcard, phrase, or biometric input (finger, hand, or eye).
   o	All subjects must have unique identities.
  •	Authentication: Verifies the subject’s identity by comparing one or more factors against a database or valid identities. 
   o	Authentication information MUST be private and protected

Comparing Subjects and Objects (Page 642-643)
  •	Access is the transfer of information from an object to a subject, which makes it important to understand the definition of both subject and object.
  •	Subject: A subject is an active entity that accesses a passive object to receive information from, or data about, an object. Subjects can be users, programs, processes, services, computers, or anything else that can access a resource.
  •	Object: An object is a passive entity that provides information to active subjects. Examples of objects are files, databases, computers, programs, processes, services, printers, and storage media.

Registration, Proofing, and Establishment of Identity (Page 643-644)
  •	Establishment of Identity: Providing documentation such including physical documents (passport, driver’s license, birth certificate, etc.). 
  •	Registration: Providing an identify and authentication access within an organization to a user; this can be setting up a username and password.
  •	Knowledge-based Authentication (KBA) – Information for identity proofing someone new such including information about themselves. 
    o	Example questions for this authentication:
      	Which of the following vehicles have you recently purchased?
      	How much is your car payment?
      	How much is your mortgage (or rental) payment?
  •	Cognitive password (Security Questions): Questions which challenge the user’s authentication process which only the registered identity user knows. Example questions:
    o	What is your favorite sport?
    o	What is the color of your first car?
    o	What is the name of your first pet?

Authorization and Accountability (Page 644)
  •	Authorization: Subjects are granted access to objects based on proven identities
  •	Accountability: Users and other subjects can be held accountable for their actions when auditing is implemented. 
    o	Auditing: Tracks subjects and records when they access objects, creating an audit trail in one or more audit logs.

  Authorization (Page 644-645)
    •	Authorization indicates who is trusted to perform specific operations. If the action is allowed, the subject is authorized; if disallowed, the subject is not authorized.

  Accountability (Page 645)
    •	Auditing, logging, and monitoring provide accountability by ensuring that subjects can be held accountable for their actions. Auditing is the process of tracking and recording subject activities within logs.
    •	Logs: Record actions taken by an identity if when and where this took place. One or more logs provides an audit trail to reconstruct events and activities conducted by the identity to hold people accountable for security violations. 

Authentication Factors Overview (Page 645-646)
  •	Something you know: The something you know factor of authentication includes memorized secrets such as a password, personal identification number (PIN), or passphrase.
  •	Something you have: The something you have factor of authentication includes physical devices that a user possesses and can help them provide authentication.
  •	Something you are: The something you are factor of authentication uses physical characteristics of a person and is based on biometrics.
  •	Single-Factor Authentication: Uses only one factor of authentication from “Something you know,” “Something you have,” and “Something you are.”
  •	Multifactor authentication: Uses two or more authentication factors from “Something you know,” “Something you have,” and “Something you are.”
  •	Somewhere you are: The somewhere you are factor identifies a subject's location based on a specific computer, a geographic location identified by an Internet Protocol (IP) address, or a phone number identified by Caller ID.
  •	Context-Aware Authentication: It can identify multiple attributes such as the user's location, the time of day, and the mobile device. If the user meets all the requirements (location, time, and type of device in this example), it allows the user to log on using the other methods, such as with a username and password.
