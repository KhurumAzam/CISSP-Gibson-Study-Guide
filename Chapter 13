Controlling Access to Assets (Page 639-640)
  •	Tangible: assets refer to things you can touch, such as physical equipment.
  •	Intangible: assets refer to information and data, such as intellectual property
  •	Assets within an Organization
    o Information – An organization’s information includes all its data.
    o Logical access controls attempt to prevent unauthorized access to the information.
    o	Systems - An organization’s systems include any IT systems that provide one or more services
    o	Devices - Devices refer to any computing system, including routers, switches, servers, desktop computers, portable laptop computers, tablets, smartphones, and external devices such as printers
    o	Facilities - An organization’s facilities include any physical location that it owns or rents.
    o	Applications - Applications frequently provide access to an organization’s data.

Controlling Physical and Logical Access (Page 640)
  •	Physical Security Controls protect Systems, Devices, and Facilities by controlling access and controlling the environment.
  •	Logical Access Controls are the technical controls used to protect access to Information, systems, devices, and applications. They include authentication, authorization, and permissions. 

The CIA Triad and Access Controls (Page 640-641)
  •	There are three categories of IT Loss: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA).
   o	Confidentiality: Access Controls help ensure that only authorized subjects can access objects.
      	When unauthorized entities can access systems or data, it results in a loss of confidentiality.
   o	Integrity: Ensures that data or system configurations are not modified without authorizations, or if unauthorized changes occur, security controls detect the changes.
   o	Availability: Authorized requests for objects must be granted to subjects within a reasonable amount of time. If systems are not operational or the data is not accessible, it results in a loss of availability. 

Managing Identification and Authentication (Page 641-642)
  •	Identification: The process of a subject claiming, or professing, and identity. The subject providing an identity will start the authentication, authorization, and accountability processes. This can be typing a username, smartcard, phrase, or biometric input (finger, hand, or eye).
   o	All subjects must have unique identities.
  •	Authentication: Verifies the subject’s identity by comparing one or more factors against a database or valid identities. 
   o	Authentication information MUST be private and protected

Comparing Subjects and Objects (Page 642-643)
  •	Access is the transfer of information from an object to a subject, which makes it important to understand the definition of both subject and object.
  •	Subject: A subject is an active entity that accesses a passive object to receive information from, or data about, an object. Subjects can be users, programs, processes, services, computers, or anything else that can access a resource.
  •	Object: An object is a passive entity that provides information to active subjects. Examples of objects are files, databases, computers, programs, processes, services, printers, and storage media.
